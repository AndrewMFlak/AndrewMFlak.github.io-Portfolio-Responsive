				<br> Hey there, I’m Andrew. I grew up in Orlando, Florida but for the last ten years have called New Jersey home. My wife
				and I live in Jersey City, New Jersey. My hobbies are music, watching sports (soccer, football, etc), and reading. In
				my spare time, I head to the ocean and paddle out into the the surf. I’m always looking to improve my skills in the ocean
				and love the thrill I get from riding riding a wave. I also enjoy going for walks and hikes with my wife.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I work in accounting where I specialize in technology logistics at a firm called SS&C technologies. We serve as administrator
				to hedge fund and asset manager entities looking to outsource their internal operations. Day to day I provide support
				to external and internal clients clients looking to improve their efficiency in work flow processes. I am always learning
				and started the Rutgers coding boot camp in February 2018 to increase my knowledge in development. I am looking forward
				to getting creative and innovating with code. Check out this site to see some of my work and thanks for visiting.
